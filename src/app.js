          <h2>What We Believe</h2>
          <p>
            Creativity and technology are not separate domains. We nurture hybrid practices where artists gain fluency with code, circuits, and computation â€” and technologists learn to make meaning, engage community, and take poetic risks.
          </p>
          <p>
            Based in Toronto and supported by InterAccess, this intensive fills the gap between beginner workshops and academic programs with hands-on, project-based learning.
